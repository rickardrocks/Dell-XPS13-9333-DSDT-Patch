2 components involved: MEI driver (AppleIntelMEIDriver) and ME controller (AppleMEClientController), both packaged within the framebuffer kext.

As long as the driver can't write to the ME, sleep/shutdown after 3+ hours running is fixed. 2 ways to do that:
 - Prevent the driver from starting by following 'disabled by plist' in AppleIntelMEIDriver::start()
 - Prevent the driver from writing to ME by jumping over AppleIntelMEIDriver::writeMessageToME(). Note: make sure the call returns 0 or it creates load in the kernel, breaking speedstep (symptom: kernel_task stuck at ~7% cpu constantly).

At this point, some issues:
 - Slow boot (adds ~15 seconds to boot)
 - Coming back from sleep, screen is stuck at min brightness for a couple minutes.

The above issues disappear if the ME controller is disabled (i.e. prevented from starting). But that creates yet some other issues (hang with quicktime, slow opening of vlc). This is the current compromise I'm running.

However, this means the issues of slow boot/low brightness are triggered in the controller (makes sense.. driver is probably called through the controller from the kernel/rest of the OS). Next step is to find a clean fix for these issues in the controller. So far:
 - Patch AppleMEClientController::sendMessage --> no change
 - Patch AppleMEClientController::sendCommon --> no change

Places to look into:
	AppleIntelMEIDriver::gatedSetPowerState()
	AppleIntelMEIDriver::sendCommon()
	AppleIntelMEIDriver::start() --> disabled via plist (known working)
	AppleIntelMEIDriver::writeMessageToME() (known working)
	  - Try jumping before calcFreeDWords
	  - Try jumping to -1 destination (xor eax eax) to pretend the call was successful

	KO -- AppleMEClientController::start(IOService*)
	KO -- AppleMEClientController::setupPM(IOService*)
	KO -- AppleMEClientController::sendMessage (...)
