Installation: had to boot with ig-platform-id ending in 08 to get to the installer
Post-installation: have to boot with ig-platform-id ending in 06 to get to desktop

- Install Clover (AptioFix64 only)
Note: ended up dd from disk1s1 to disk0s1 (i.e. copy EFI from USB to HD). Might have been just because i didnâ€™t set up the EFI boot right in bios (EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.efi) let the file chooser do it in BIOS. So the next 2 steps were already done..

- Copy Hfsplus.efi to drivers64UEFI

- Copy fakesmc & voodoops2 to /EFI/kext/10.9

- Install voodoo daemon
cd Downloads/MV/RehabMan-Voodoo-2014-0523
sudo cp org.rehabman.voodoo.driver.Daemon.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
(Edit plist to point to /usr/local/bin)
sudo cp Release/VoodooPS2Daemon /usr/local/bin/

- Copy config.plist to /EFI
cp xps13/clover/config.plist /Volumes/ESP/EFI/CLOVER/

- Get iAsl
sudo cp ./iasl /usr/local/bin/

- Generate ssdt
./ssdtPRGen.sh -d 0

- copy ssdt.aml to /EFI/ACPI/patched

- Generate DSDT & GFX ssdt, and place in clover

- Inject appropriate channels in EAPD commander (headphones 21 / speakers 20?)

- copy ACPI backlight, ACPI Battery and EAPD commander to clover kext

- copy modified appleHDA to /S/L/E
